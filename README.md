## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a sophomore at Brown University in Computer Science with years of hobby and in-school experience in software engineering across the stack from web, to backend, to systems programming. I'm passionate about computer systems and low-level development, and am pursuing a career in Software Engineering in those areas.
